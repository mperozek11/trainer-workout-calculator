The goal for this project is to create a tool which accepts a garmin fit file as an input and uses power and time data to estimate the distance of the outdoor ride. 

//TODO latex this section properly
Math:
For a given Velocity V, there is a certain power required to maintain speed. Call this Pneeded

Pneeded can be calculated by the resistive force * the velocity

The resistive force is modelled by the sum of the force of gravity, rolling resistance, and drag

To find acceleration, subtract the Pneeded to maintain the current velocity from the actual power output at that time to get the available power (Pexcess)

Power for acceleration (Paccel) can be modelled as Pexcess / V

instantaneous acceleration (a) is thus equal to Paccel / total mass

to determine the new velocity from an acceleration
